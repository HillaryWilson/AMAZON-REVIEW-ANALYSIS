# AMAZON-REVIEW-ANALYSIS
**Excel-based analysis of Amazon product reviews using Pivot tables for analysis and Dashboard for visualization**
---
This project analyzes Amazon product data to uncover insights into pricing strategies, discounts, customer engagement, and performance. The goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions on marketing, pricing, and inventory.

I used Microsoft Excel with pivot tables and charts to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Products** (Rows): 1,465  
- **Columns**: 16, including:
  - Product Name
  - Product Category
  - Actual Price, Discounted Price
  - Discount %, Rating, Rating Count
  - Review Titles and Content
---

## Project Objectives

Using Excel pivot tables, calculated fields, and visualizations, the following questions were answered:

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue by category (Actual Price √ó Rating Count)?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products by rating and number of reviews combined.

## Key Excel Formulas & Code Snippets

### Data Cleaning
**Creating category classes**
Category class 1
```excel
=TRIM(LEFT([@category], FIND("|", [@category]) - 1))
```
Category class 2
```excel
=TRIM(MID([@category], FIND("|", [@category]) + 1, FIND("|", [@category], FIND("|", [@category]) + 1) - FIND("|", [@category]) - 1))
```
Category class 1
```excel
=TRIM(MID([@category], FIND("|", [@category], FIND("|", [@category]) + 1) + 1, FIND("|", [@category], FIND("|", [@category], FIND("|", [@category]) + 1) + 1) - FIND("|", [@category], FIND("|", [@category]) + 1) - 1))
```

**Shortening Product name**
```excel
=LEFT([@[product_name]], 27)
```


### Calculated Columns

**1. Potential Revenue**
```excel
=Actual Price * Rating_Count
```

**2. Price Bucket (using IF)**
```excel
=IF([@[discounted_price]]<200, "<200", IF([@[discounted_price]]<=500, "200-500", ">500"))
```

**3. Rating Category**
```excel
=IF([@[rating_count]]>1000, "More than 1000", "Fewer than 1000")
```

**4. High Discount Flag (‚â•50%)**
```excel
=IF([@Discount %]>=50, "Yes", "No")
```

**5. Combined Score (for Q14)**
```excel
=IFERROR( VALUE([@rating]) * VALUE(([@[rating_count]]/1000)), 0)
```

**6. Discount Bucket (using IF)**
```excel
=IF([@[discount_percentage]]<20%, "<20%", IF([@[discount_percentage]]<=40%, "20%-40%", IF([@[discount_percentage]]<=60%, "41%-60%", IF([@[discount_percentage]]<=80%, "61%-80%", ">80%"))))
```
